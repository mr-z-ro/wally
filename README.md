# Wally

This project is under active development, but will eventually be an interface builder for a wall-mounted, touchscreen monitor.

## What is it?
As I expressed to a friend after sending a screenshot, I am "building a wall-mounted touchscreen interface (likely using a pi) for a bunch of stuff that I want to see regularly without sitting at a computer (calendar, tasks, music recognition, temp/humid/pressure/radon detection, etc)." We shall see what it ends up as.

## Project setup

```
cd WALLY_DIR
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run-script serve
```

Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
